A special thanks to Dr.Churchill for implementing a fun and great way to learn path searching methods. And also for giving me permission to share my experience with these assignments. Dr.Churchill spent months programming these assignments and the source codes are not available. Please sent me an email klan@mun.ca if you have any questions!

For this assignment, students were required to implement BFS, DFS methods to find the shortest path between two locations. The target can be of size 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3 grids. Heuristic functions were implemented to guess how much distance remaining. There were four different heuristics: Eucildean 2D distance, Cardinal Manhattan, Diagonal Manhattan, Return Zero.
The program must also pass random tests located at the left side.

Students were also required to test the connectivity of the path, meaning the 3x3 grid could only move in the grids that were in pink.
